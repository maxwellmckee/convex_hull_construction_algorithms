# 3d_Convex_Hull-Algorithm
Given a set of points in R^3, construct the convex hull of the pointset using the vertices that define the outer planes of the pointset.
------------------------
* Have user input a number n to generate a random set of points in R^3 
* Determine which sets of 3 points from the pointset form a plane that is on the "outside" of the pointset
* Plot each triangular plane defined by the sets of 3 points to form a 3D convex shape around the pointset
* Show which points do not lie on the convex hull inside of the shape
